    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This is a small side project I made when I realised that there is no reliable service to describe <em>and</em> show the next execution
    times of a cron through timezones. A use case which I faced at work.</p>

    <p>If you find an error please <a href="mailto:contact@cronverifier.com">contact me via mail</a> or hand in an issue in <a href="https://github.com/denniskawurek/cron-verifier-ui">Github</a></p>
    <p>
      And also please double check your cron! Although I try to test as much cases as possible I cannot warranty that exactly yours will work.
