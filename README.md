# Cron verifier

Code for [cronverifier.com](https://cronverifier.com).

This project bases on VueJS and a (currently non-public) library from me to parse, describe and calculate next execution times of a Cron.

If you find any false values for a cron, please don't hesitate to hand in an issue. I'm happy for as much use cases to test as possible!

## Setup
```
npm install
npm run serve
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

## Dependencies

This project depends on the great work of other Open Source projects.
Mainly the [Vue.js 3](https://vuejs.org) framework and [PrimeVue](https://www.primefaces.org/primevue) for the fronted design.
